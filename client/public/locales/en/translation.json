The total amount to be paid by the customer and the amount of the fee will always be clearly specified in the payment plan and before finalizing the purchase.",

This fee is intended solely to cover financial and operational processing costs of the FitX platform and does not represent additional profit. This fee does not apply to cancellations made within the 7-day period guaranteed by the Código de Defesa do Consumidor, which always results in a full refund.",
    "refundTerm4": "In addition to the application of the 10% administrative fee to the refund requested by the client after the legal 7-day cooling-off period, the amount corresponding to the FitX service fee (charged at the time of purchasing the plan) will not be refunded. The refund, therefore, will be calculated only on the purchase amount, minus the administrative fee.",
    "refundTerm5": "After submitting a cancellation request, the trainer may contact the client within 10 days to attempt to reverse the decision. The client may withdraw the cancellation request at any time during this period.",
    "refundTerm6": "If the trainer accepts the request or doesn't respond within 10 days, the refund will be processed automatically, based on the date the request was submitted by the client.
